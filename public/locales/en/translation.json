  "aboutKanban": {
    "p1": "Kanban in Japanese means 'signboard' or 'billboard'. The method appeared as part of the famous Toyota production system, from which the concept of lean manufacturing grew. Kanban has spread from the automaker's assembly line to almost all areas of business, receiving special recognition in IT, where it has become part of agile and scrum development methodologies.",
    "p2": "This method of development implements the principle of 'just in time' and contributes to an even distribution of workload between employees. With this approach, the entire development process is transparent to all team members. Tasks are placed into a separate list as they arrive, from where each developer can extract the required task. Kanban is a visual development system that shows what needs to be created, when and how much.",
    "p3": "Kanban boards are just one part of the kanban method. In fact, it is a set of change management principles, principles of service orientation and about 150 practices."
